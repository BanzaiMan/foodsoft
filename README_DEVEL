README for DEVELopment Project Setup
====================================

Gratulations, you have successfully cloned the foodsoft project
from the git repository. Now you are only a few steps away from
trying it out and then jumping into development. (This manual presumes
you have ruby and rails setup.)

(1) Configure datebase
----------------------
Create the database configuration from the default:

    cp config/database.yml.SAMPLE config/database.yml

If you are fine with using a file-based sqlite database you are all set.
The sqlite files (development/test/production) will reside in the "db" directory.
Otherwise you would want to edit database.yml to suit your needs (MySQL whatever).
	

(2) Configure development environment
-------------------------------------
Again, you need to create your own copy of the default configuration:

	cp config/environments/development.rb.SAMPLE config/environments/development.rb

Edit development.rb to specify your settings (at least the ActionMailer SMTP settings).
If you just leave the file as is, emails will not work but everything else should be okay.


(3) Foodsoft settings
---------------------
You need to create your own copy of the foodsoft configuration settings:

	cp config/app_config.yml.SAMPLE config/app_config.yml

Edit app_config.yml to suit your needs or just keep the defaults for now.


(4) Secret Token
-------------------
The user session are stored in cookies. Do avoid misusing the cookies and its sensitive information, rails
will encrypt it with a token. So copy the config file

   cp config/initializers/secret_token.rb.SAMPLE config/initializers/secret_token.rb

and modify the token!!


(5) Required ruby and gems
-------------------
We reccomend the using of rvm (https://rvm.beginrescueend.com/). Install rvm and get the latest ruby (>= 1.9.3).
If installed you only need to install the gem bundler:

    gem install bundler

After that you get the other gems easily with (from project root):

    bundle install


(6) Create database (schema) and load defaults
--------------------------
	rake db:setup

With this, you also get a ready to go user with username 'admin' and password 'secret'.


(7) Try it out!
---------------	
Start the WEBrick server to try it out:
	
	script/server


(8) (optional) Get background jobs done
---------------------------------------
We use for time intensive tasks a background job queue, at the moment delayed job. To deliver mails etc you have to
start the workers:

    rake jobs:work

or as a daemon process in the background

    scrip/delayed_job start # and stop
