== FoodSoft

Web-based software to manage a non-profit food coop (product catalog, ordering, accounting, job scheduling).

== Install

Have a look on README_DEVEL.

Update, it is highly recommended to checkout the rails3 branch. As soon as possible I will merge this branch
into master. So for beginnners, better start with the new (I hope much easier) code.

git checkout -b rails3 origin/rails3
